### App functionality:

- [x] drag and drop to move cards between column.A user should be able to move cards between columns (UX is up to you, does not need to be
      drag-and-drop).
- [x] Do make sure the available interactions are intuitive. In other words, we will be considering usability.

### What would I do if I had more time:

- Better styling.
- Mobile version / Responsive.
- Write more unity tests and JSDocs.
- Write Integration tests using [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
